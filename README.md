# 📍 Nostr Spatial Anchors

### _Decentralized Map Journal & Location Log_

**Nostr Spatial Anchors** is a privacy-focused, decentralized web client that allows users to create a personal logbook of locations directly on the **Nostr protocol** ⚡. Built with a clean, "glassmorphism" aesthetic, it bridges the gap between physical locations and digital identity.

- **📖 Intuitive Journaling**: A dedicated "Anchor Journal" to track, view, and manage your location history with advanced filtering.
